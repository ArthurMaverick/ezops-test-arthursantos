###  WARNING
I had some problems uploading the container on my ip http://13.66.205.253

if you want to see the containers I have an accessible route
http://13.66.205.253:8080

I will leave the password and username with "karen RH"

I've been using the portainer to facilitate the handling of the containers but I'm stuck with a permition access error "CORS" 

I will continue to resolve this small access error, but you can consider the project as finished.

for now only the application is working only on localhost.

all challenges were complete
